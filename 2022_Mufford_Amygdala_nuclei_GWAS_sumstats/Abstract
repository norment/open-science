Background: Whereas genetic variants influencing total amygdala volume have been identified, the genetic architecture of its distinct nuclei have yet to be explored. We aimed to investigate whether increased phenotypic specificity through segmentation of the nuclei aids genetic discoverability and elucidates the extent of shared genetic architecture and biological pathways overlapping with related disorders. 
Methods: T1-weighted brain MRI scans (n=36,352, mean age= 64.26 years, 52% female) of trans-ancestry individuals from the UK Biobank were segmented into nine amygdala nuclei with FreeSurfer v6.1. Genome-wide association analyses were performed on the entire sample and a White-European-only subset (n=31,690). We estimated SNP-based heritability using Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis, derived estimates of polygenicity, discoverability and power using MiXer, identified genetic correlations and shared loci with psychiatric disorders using bivariate MiXeR and conjunctional FDR, respectively, followed by functional annotation using FUMA.
Results: The heritability of the nuclei ranged between 0.17-0.33. Across the whole amygdala and the nuclei volumes, 38 novel genome-wide significant (padj < 5x10-9) loci were identified, with the most loci and statistical power for discovery mapped to the central nucleus. The mapped genes and associated pathways show both unique and shared effects across the nuclei, including immune, DNA modification, and circadian-related pathways. Shared variants were identified between specific nuclei and autism spectrum disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. 
Conclusions: Our findings indicate that amygdala nuclei volumes have significant genetic heritability. They also provide increased power for discovery compared to whole amygdala volume, have unique and shared genetic architectures, biological pathways, and genetic overlap with psychiatric disorders.
