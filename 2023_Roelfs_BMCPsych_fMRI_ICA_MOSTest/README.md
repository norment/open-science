## Scripts

The other folders contain scripts, in R, Python, MATLAB, or bash. Each folder contains a description of which scripts to run in what order to obtain the results described in the paper. For the scripts required to prepare the datafiles for FUMA, the scripts are identical to the files from the Roelfs 2024 fMRI MOSTest paper (see `6_clump_results` in the corresponding directory)

The scripts in this directory have been simplified compared to the scripts used in analysis to improve usability, accessibility, and readability
