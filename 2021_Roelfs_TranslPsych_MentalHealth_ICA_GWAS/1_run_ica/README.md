# Run ICA

Scripts to residualize the z-normalized questionnaire data and run the ICA. Note that the seed in the `PerformICA.R` script will provice the ICs in a different order than reported in the paper, we relabeled ICs to maintain consistency with earlier analyses.

Scripts in order:
1.  `ResidualiseNormalized.R`
1.  `PerformICA.R`
